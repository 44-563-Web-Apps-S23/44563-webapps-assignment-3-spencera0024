        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Computer Science major at Northwest Missouri State University. This is my 2nd year here after transferring from the University of Kansas. I am taking Web Apps because I know the industry uses them a lot based on past interview experiences. A fun fact about me that not many people know is that I am left-handed.</p>
        <h3>Favorite Book: A Game of Thrones</h3>
            <p>A Game of Thrones is my favorite book because you could never predict what was going to happen next. There were many characters and settings and the story created a very unique world that is hard to be uninterested in.</p>
