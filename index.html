        <h2>Favorite Sport: American Football</h2>
        <p>I enjoy football because the game is almost always close. There <b>never</b> seems to be a dull moment in the game. There also aren't that many games in a season, making each one feel super <b>special</b>.</p>

        <h2>Countries that I recommend visiting:</h2>
        <p>I have never left the United States, but from what I have heard from other people, the following four countries are worth visiting. I hope to visit them someday myself. After I graduate, I hope to take a small trip to Europe to a couple different countires at least.</p>
